IMDB is a movie and shows review site where critics and movie fans leave reviews. The platform has reviews of nearly every TV series, show, or drama from most languages. It's a substantial dataset source for performing sentiment analysis on the reviews.

The movie review analysis is a classic multi-class model problem since a movie can have multiple sentiments -- negative, somewhat negative, neutral, fairly positive, and positive. Since a movie review can have additional characters like emojis and special characters, the extracted data must go through data normalization. Text processing stages like tokenization and bag of words (number of occurrences of words within the text) can be performed by using the NLTK (natural language toolkit) library. The entertainment industry takes critic reviews seriously, and it also helps production houses to understand why their series or movie succeeded (or failed). Critic reviews also influence the commercial success of a drama and movie since people check reviews before booking their movie tickets. With sentiment analysis, production houses can figure out the general opinion of critics. 

In this project, Found out the sentiment of movie reviews(Good or Bad) using ML algorithms(Naive Bayes) and deep learning algorithms(LSTMs) Did a comparison of these two techniques by comparing the accuracy of the results obtained.
